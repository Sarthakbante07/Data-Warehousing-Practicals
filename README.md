## Practical 6

**AIM:**
- Design, create, and populate a data warehouse using sample data from multiple sources in Google Firestore.

**Dataset:**
- Sample data used for creating the data warehouse.

**Code:**
- Link to the code file for designing and populating the data warehouse.

---

## Practical 7

**AIM:**
- Perform OLAP operations on a data warehouse to analyze sales data stored in Firestore.
